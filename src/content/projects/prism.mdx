## Human-AI Collaboration

The central design challenge was balance: how do you give users the power of generative AI without making them feel like passengers? We designed a "steering wheel" metaphor — the AI suggests, the human directs.

## Creative Workflow

The workflow follows a diverge-converge pattern: generate many options quickly, then curate and refine. The interface adapts its density based on which phase the user is in.

## Interface Design

We used a canvas-based interface with floating panels, allowing creators to arrange their workspace around their content rather than the other way around.
