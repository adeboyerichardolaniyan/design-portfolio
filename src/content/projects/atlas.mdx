description: "Atlas is an experimental tool for exploring interconnected datasets through a spatial, map-like interface. Instead of traditional tables and charts, users navigate data as a landscape — zooming, panning, and discovering clusters of related information."

## Spatial Metaphor

Traditional data tools force users into rigid structures — rows, columns, hierarchies. Atlas breaks free by treating data points as locations in a navigable space, where proximity implies relationship.

## Interaction Design

The core interaction model borrows from digital maps: pinch to zoom reveals more detail, pan to explore adjacent clusters, and tap to drill into individual data points.

## Visual System

The visual system uses elevation, blur, and color temperature to encode data density and recency. Hot zones glow warmer, sparse regions fade to cool grays.
