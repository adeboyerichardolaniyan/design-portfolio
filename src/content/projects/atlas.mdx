description: "Atlas is an experimental tool for exploring interconnected datasets through a spatial, map-like interface. Instead of traditional tables and charts, users navigate data as a landscape — zooming, panning, and discovering clusters of related information."

## Spatial Metaphor

Traditional data tools force users into rigid structures — rows, columns, hierarchies. Atlas breaks free by treating data points as locations in a navigable space, where proximity implies relationship.

## Interaction Design

The core interaction model borrows from digital maps: pinch to zoom reveals more detail, pan to explore adjacent clusters, and tap to drill into individual data points.

Drag the slider to compare the evolution from wireframe to final interface:

## Visual System

The visual system uses elevation, blur, and color temperature to encode data density and recency. Hot zones glow warmer, sparse regions fade to cool grays.
