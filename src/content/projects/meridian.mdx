## Design Language

The visual language for Meridian was built on principles of clarity and composability. Every token, every component, every pattern was designed to work independently and in concert.

## Token Architecture

We developed a three-tier token system: primitive values, semantic tokens, and component-specific tokens. This allowed teams to customize their products while maintaining system-wide consistency.

Explore the token system interactively below — select tokens and preview how they render across different border radius values:

## Component Library

The component library shipped with 60+ components, each with comprehensive documentation, usage guidelines, and interactive examples.
