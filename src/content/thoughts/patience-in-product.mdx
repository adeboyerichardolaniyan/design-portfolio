The hardest part of product work isn't coming up with ideas. It's waiting for the right moment to build them. Every product person I admire has an almost unreasonable tolerance for ambiguity — a willingness to sit with a half-formed thought until it crystallizes.

Shipping fast is important. But shipping the right thing is more important. And knowing the difference requires patience that doesn't come naturally in environments optimized for velocity.

I've learned to trust the slow days. The days where nothing gets merged but everything gets clearer. Those are often the days that matter most. A conversation at a whiteboard. A sketch that finally clicks. A question that reframes the entire problem.

Speed is a tool. Patience is a skill. The best products come from teams that know when to use each.
