Every tool carries an opinion about how work should be done. Figma thinks in frames and auto-layout. Code thinks in trees and state. Pen and paper think in nothing at all, which is why they remain the best tool for the earliest ideas.

I was asked recently which tool I'd recommend for someone starting out in design. My answer was: all of them, briefly. Then pick the one that disappears when you're working. The best tool is the one you stop noticing.

There's a tendency to over-invest in tooling — to spend more time configuring the workspace than doing the work. I've fallen into this trap many times. The solution is always the same: close everything, open a blank page, and start.

The craft is in the thinking, not the clicking.
